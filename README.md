# CloudFlareDynDNS

A rough and ready shell script to run from a CRON updating the specified subdomain on CloudFlare

It works (and I've been using it for a couple of years), but there are probably some more appealing alternatives.

Requirements:
- dig
- curl

Enough of these exist - but here is mine in just shell script.
